    "Divide & conquer is a method for designing algorithms that solve problems by breaking the problem into smaller subproblems and then solving those smaller problems by dividing further until some base case is reached when the problem is small enough. Once the base case is reached we solve that subproblem and then use that solution to solve the larger problem by combining it with solutions to the other smaller subproblems we have solved. Merge sort is a nice example of this that we will go over. As you can probably guess from this description divide & conquer is very closely tied to the concept of recursion.\n"

    "Now the $\\text{merge}$ function is the crucial component here as it defines how we combine the resulting sorted lists. Let's think about how we would combine two sorted (ascending order) lists $L_1$ and $L_2$ into a list $L$. Well since both lists are sorted when now that the first element of the combined list will either be the first element of $L_1$ or the first element of $L_2$. But why are we assuming the lists are sorted? It isn't super clear where the lists are getting sorted in the first place. So the key thing to think about is the case where $\\text{merge_sort}$'s base case is reached. When this happens we just return a a list with one element. Once this happens we start to recurse back up the recursion tree. So the $\\text{merge}$ function is called with the input lists being single element lists. At that point we just compare the elements in both lists and concatenate them based on which is smaller as is done by the last two conditional statements in the $\\text{merge}$ function. After this we move up one level in the recursion tree $\\text{merge}$ is called again but this time the lists have length 2. So we can see that once we get to the top of the recursion tree we will have two list whose sizes, $n$ and $m$ respectively, add up to the size adds up to the length of the original input list. Clearly the $\\text{merge}$ function compares the first element of $L_1$ with the first element of $L_2$ and then compares the second element of $L_1$ with the second element of $L_2$ and so on. This means $\\text{merge}$ does $O(n+m)$ operations meaning the time for the merge step is linear in the size of the two lists. So we take a problem of size $n$ and divide it into two subproblems of size $\\frac{n}{2}$ and solve each of these subproblems in time $O(n)$ thus the runtime of merge sort is characterized by the recurrence\n",

As an example lets take the following list\n",

Well it's certainly in $L_l$ since that is the list with all elements smaller than $w$. Where is the second smallest element? Also in $L_l$. The third smallest element is also in $L_l$. Now what about the fourth smallest? Well that would be in $L_w$ since the first 3 smallest elements are in $L_l$. What about the sixth smallest element? Well it can't be in $L_l$ since that contains the first 3 smallest, and it can't be in $L_w$ since that contains the next 2 smallest so it must be in $L_g$, and more importantly it will be the smallest number in $L_g$. The seventh smallest number can be found in the same way except this time it will be the *second* smallest element in $L_g$. So to put it in general terms if we want the $k$-th smallest element if $k \\leq |L_l|$ then we know the $k$-th smallest element is in $L_l$ and we can simply ignore the other two list. If $k > |L_l|+|L_w|$ then we know the $k$-th smallest element is in $L_g$. And if neither condition is true then that means $|L_s|<k\\leq |L_l|+|L_w|$ which means the element we want is in $L_w$ i.e. the element is $w$ itself. The pseudocode is given below."

What if we just pick $w$ randomly (hence why this is a randomized divide & conquer algorithm)? The worst case scenario here is that we want to run the algorithm for $k=1$, so we want the smallest element in the list, and pick a $w$ that is the largest element in the list each time which would only reduce the size of the list by one at each recursive call.

    "We have two lists $A=a_1,...,a_n$ and $B=b_1,...,b_m$ that are sorted in non-descending order and we want to find the $k$-th smallest element in the union (combination) of these two lists. The straightforward method is to simply concatenate the lists and use either FastSelect which is $\\Theta(n+m)$ time or QuickSelect which is $O(n+m)$ expected time. But the problem wants us to do this in $O(\\log(n)+\\log(m))$ time. This makes me think we need to use concepts from merge sorts merge step, since the arrays are sorted, and the concepts from the selection algorithm since we want to find the $k$-th smallest number.\n",

    "We'll have to utilize the fact that the two lists are sorted to solve this problem. Let's start by asking where the *smallest* element in the union would be. Well it's going to either be $a_1$ or $b_1$ since those are the smallest elements from the two respective lists. \n",

    "Now let $M_m$ and $M_n$ be the index of the middle of list $A$ and $B$ respectively. If $M_m + M_n \\geq k$ what does that tell us? By extending our thought experiment from above we can conclude that the $k$-th smallest element must be "
