We can iterate over the CNF boolean expression and count the number of variables in the expression, denote it as $n$, this takes $O(n)$ time. Now we can count the number of variables that are set to True in the solution, denote this as $r$. Now we just need to check if $r\\leq k$ to see if the stingy constraint is satisfied. This takes $O(1)$ time. Finally, we can evaluate the CNF expression with the variable assignments in the solution and see if it evaluates to True as we would for the regular SAT problem which takes $O(n)$ time. So this whole process of verifying the solution takes polynomial time so Stingy SAT is in NP.\n",

We can straightforwardly show this by showing SAT, which is known to be NP-hard, can be reduced to Stingy-SAT. This can be done by computing the number of variables, $n$, in a CNF expression for the SAT problem and setting $k=n$. Now this is an instance of the Stingy-SAT problem and the solution to this problem is a solution to the original SAT problem with no need of modification. "
