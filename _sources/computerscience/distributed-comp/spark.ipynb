    "An important thing to note about transformations in Spark is that, generally, they are *lazy* operations; meaning they aren't accualy performed/computed until the resulting dataframe/result set is needed. Generally this means the transformation isn't applied until an *action* is specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of transformations: narrow and wide transformations. The difference between the two is that *wide* transformations induce what is called a *shuffle* (also called an *exchange*). A shuffle is when a *repartitioning* of the dataset is required. Spark basically works by partitioning the dataset into subsets and having each worker perform the specified computation on a partition of the data. It's easy to think of transformations that would require a shuffle such as the `sort()` operation. Clearly this will require an exchange/shuffle since one needs to compare rows from different partitions to perform a sort. And example of a narrow transformation is the `filter()` transformation. Clearly there is no need to compare rows across partitions to accomplish this operation since we just need to check if a row fulfills the criteria in the filter clause to compute the result set.\n",
