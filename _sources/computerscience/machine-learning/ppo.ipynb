    "## Brief Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with Actor-Critic Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an environment which can be modeled as a Markov decision process with state space $\\mathcal{S}$, action space $\\mathcal{A}$, state transition function $\\mathcal{T}(s,a)$ and reward function $R(s)$ the goal of reinforcement learning is to learn an optimal policy $\\pi^*(s)$ from experiences interacting with the environment. A policy defines how an agent selects an action when in a particular state $s_t$ at time step $t$ such that the sum of discounted future rewards, defined as \n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\gamma^kR_{t+k+1},\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "is maximized. The hyperparameter $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$ is the discount factor and controls how much we discount rewards received at later time steps. The closer $\\gamma$ is to 0 the greater rewards received at earlier time steps are weighted than those received at later time steps. In general polices are functions mapping states to probabilities of selecting each possible action. \n",
    "Another important function in reinforcement learning is the value function $V_\\pi(s)$. Canonically the value function is defined as \n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    V_\\pi(s) = \\mathbb{E}_\\pi\\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\gamma^kR_{t+k+1}\\bigg| S_t=s\\right].\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "This is the expected sum of discounted future rewards when the agent begins in state $s$ at time step $t$ and follows the policy $\\pi$ for the remaining time steps. The expectation $\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}[\\cdot]$ is used because both the policy and the environment are in general stochastic and the reward is thus a random variable. This function provides us a way to evaluate policies since a policy $\\pi$ can be defined to be better than policy $\\pi'$ if $V_{\\pi}(s)\\geq V_{\\pi'}(s)$ for all $s\\in \\mathcal{S}$ {cite:p}`sutton2018reinforcement`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our reinforcement learning algorithm we use the $\\texttt{StableBaselines3}$ implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm {cite:p}`schulman2017proximal`. $\\texttt{StableBaselines3}$ is an open source reinforcement learning library that provides implementations of several common reinforcement learning algorithms {cite:p}`raffin2021stable`. PPO comes from a broader class of reinforcement learning methods called actor-critic methods {cite:p}`sutton2018reinforcement`. The actor is meant to learn an optimal policy while the critic evaluates the policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actor is modeled as a neural network and selects the optimal action given the state of the environment as it's input. In this work the state was represented as the flattened density matrix of the input quantum state $\\rho_j$ i.e.\n",
    "$s_j=[\\textrm{Re}(\\rho_j^{u}), \\textrm{Im}(\\rho_j^{u}), \n",
    "\\textrm{diag}(\\rho_j)] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N^2}$ where $\\rho_j^{u}$ denotes all entries of $\\rho_j$ that are above its diagonal and $N$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space. \n",
    "The actor network has three fully connected hidden layers of size 256, 128, and 64 respectively. The output layer of the network consists of three outputs. \n",
    "These outputs are  $\\mu_1$, $\\mu_2$ and $\\sigma$ where $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ are the means of two Gaussian distributions respectively and $\\sigma$ is their standard deviation. \n",
    "The first action (the squeezing parameter $r$) is then sampled from the Gaussian $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1, \\sigma)$ and the second action (the transmitivity of the beamsplitter $\\tau$) is sampled from the Gaussian $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2, \\sigma)$. \n",
    "At the start of training the standard deviation is set to 1 and typically decreases as the training progresses and the agent begins moving away from exploration. The policy is thus stochastic during training to allow for exploration. However, during inference (evaluation) the policy is made deterministic by always selecting the mean of the Gaussian as the action.\n",
    "The critic is also modeled as a neural network with the same input and hidden layer architecture  with the only difference being that there is only one output. Given the state of the environment the critic attempts to approximate the value function $V_\\pi(s)$ where $\\pi$ is the current policy learned by the actor. We give an approximate outline of the $\\texttt{StableBaselines3}$ implementation of PPO in Algorithm \\ref{alg:ppo} and go over the details in the next section. Note that in lines 33 and 37 of the algorithm we use the stochastic gradient ascent update rule for updating the network parameters for brevity, however in the numerical experiments presented in the main text we use the Adam optimizer which has a more complex update rule {cite:p}`goodfellow2016deep`."

Note that one disadvantage of PPO being an on-policy algorithm is that it is not as sample efficient as off-policy methods such as Deep $Q$-learning or Soft Actor Critic, as seen in line 41 of Algorithm \\ref{alg:ppo}, so for environments that are expensive to sample from the advantage of PPO is less clear.\n",
