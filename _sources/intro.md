# Introduction
This is a Jupyter Book of notes I create when self-studying topics related to physics, computer science, mathematics and statistics. 

## Purpose

When I'm trying to learn about a new topic for research work or just out of interest I've often found it useful to both solve problems analytically as well as code up the solution to make visualizations or just verify my calculations. Jupyter notebooks are an excellent resource for this style of self teaching. These notebooks contain explanations of the aforementioned topics in the way that I think is most clear and understandable. 

This website was largely inspired by [Aaron Reding's](https://github.com/areding) website for the graduate [Bayesian Statistics course ISYE 6420](https://areding.github.io/6420-pymc/intro.html) I took while studying at Georgia Tech.

## Site structure
This site was created with [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html).
