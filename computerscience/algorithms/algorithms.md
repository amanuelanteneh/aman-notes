# Algorithms

This section is comprised of notes I made while taking my graduate algorithms course during my time studying for my masters in computer science degree at Georgia Tech. The two main books I cite will be {cite:p}`cormen2022introduction` and {cite:p}`dasgupta2008algorithms`. The former was used in my undergraduate algorithms course and the latter was used in the graduate algorithms course at Georgia Tech.
