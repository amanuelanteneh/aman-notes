    "Greedy algorithms are those which solve a problem by making *locally* optimal choices at each step of the algorithm. For example for the knapsack problem a greedy algorithm would scan the list of items and add the item with the highest value to weight ratio to the knapsack (assuming the item can fit). It would then repeat this process until there was no capacity left in the knapsack. This approach is pretty simple and straightforward but we shouldn't be surprised that for the knapsack problem it does not work. Remarkably however there are many other problems where a greedy approach *does* work. The important part of devising a greedy algorithm is proving that the greedy choice is in fact the optimal choice not just locally but *globally* as well."
