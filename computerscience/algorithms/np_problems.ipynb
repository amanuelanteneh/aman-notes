Now take the the largest distance in the matrix $D$ and compute $nD$. To find the shortest tour which passes through all the cities (TSP-OPT) we can use a binary search on the domain of real number $[0,nD]$. \n",

    "So first start by seeing if there is a solution to TSP for $b=\\frac{nD}{2}$ if not then we look on the new range $[0,\\frac{nD}{2})$. We do this until we reach an array with a right bound $[0,x]$ that is less than the *smallest* distance in the matrix $D_{min}$ because clearly there can't be a tour that visits all cities that is shorter than that. This binary search will need to be done $\\log{(nD)}$ times and each time we use our black box algorithm for TSP which has complexity $O(\\text{poly}(n))$ so our overall complexity is $O(\\log{(nD)}\\times \\text{poly}(n))$ which is polynomial in the input size."

    "First we show Stingy-SAT is in NP. Suppose we have a solution to an instance of the Stingy SAT problem. We can iterate over the CNF boolean expression and count the number of variables in the expression, denote it as $n$, this takes $O(n)$ time. Now we can count the number of variables that are set to True in the solution, denote this as $r$. Now we just need to check if $r\\leq k$ to see if the stingy constraint is satisfied. This takes $O(1)$ time. Finally, we can evaluate the CNF expression with the variable assignments in the solution and see if it evaluates to True as we would for the regular SAT problem which takes $O(n)$ time. So this whole process of verifying the solution takes polynomial time so Stingy SAT is in NP.\n",

    "Second we need to show Stingy-SAT is NP-hard which means all problems in NP can be reduced to this problem. We can straightforwardly show this by showing SAT, which is known to be NP-hard, can be reduced to Stingy-SAT. This can be done by computing the number of variables, $n$, in a CNF expression for the SAT problem and setting $k=n$. Now this is an instance of the Stingy-SAT problem and the solution to this problem is a solution to the original SAT problem with no need of modification. "
