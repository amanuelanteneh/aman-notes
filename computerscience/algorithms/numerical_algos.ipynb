    "However there's a problem here. If we were to compute this by first computing $x^y$ directly we would end up with very large numbers. For example if $x$ and $y$ are 20-bit numbers, and since the smallest 20-bit number is $2^{19}$, then the quantity $x^y$ is *at least* $(2^{19})^{2^{19}}=2^{19(524288)}$ which is huge. Note that when I say \"smallest 20-bit number\" I mean the smallest number that you need 20-bits to represent. So if $x$ and $y$ are $n$-bit numbers then $x^y$ is in general a $(2^{n-1})^{2^{n-1}}$-bit number. This is not optimal since it would require use to use many more bits in our program than may be necessary which in turn worsens the time & space complexity. Is there a clever way to compute $x^y \\bmod N$ while keeping the number of bits need on the same order as the number of bits needed to represent $x,y$ and $N$? \n",

Also recall that for this integer we have, by definition, $x\\bmod N=r$. Now what about $x^2 \\bmod N$? Well if we use the same expression for $x$ in terms of $q,N$ and $r$ we get \n",
