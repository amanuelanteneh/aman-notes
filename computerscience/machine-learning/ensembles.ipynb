    "Ensemble methods utilize multiple models, typically called 'weak learners' as individually these models often do not achieve optimal performance, to create a single overall model that often has much better performance than the individual models in isolation. Ensemble methods are famously applied using tree based models (random forests and XGBoost) but those are by no means the only models utilized by all ensemble methods."

    "Bagging utilizes the insight of [bootstrapping](../../statistics/classic-stats/bootstrap.ipynb). It proceeds creating $B$ bootstrapped datasets from the original dataset. This is done, again as in the bootstrap scenario, by sampling data points from the original dataset _with replacement_. We then train a separate weak learner on data set $b$ leading to a fit model $\\hat{f}^{*b}(x)$. We then take these models and average their predicitions to get our final prediction for a new sample \n",

    "For regression problems we can take a simple average of the prediction and for classification models we can simply take the majority class predicted by the ensemble of models (although there are other ways of selecting a final prediction). This method drastically reduces the variance that usually accompanies using a single decision tree and in fact increasing the number of trees $B$ used will not lead to overfitting {cite:p}`james2023statistical`."
