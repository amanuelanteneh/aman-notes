"Data Shift - Covariate Shift"
"This refers to a change in P(X) with P(Y|X) remaining fixed i.e. the distribution of the input data/features changes but the conditional distribution over outputs/labels given this new distribution stays the same."
"Data Shift - Label Shift
This refers to a change in P(Y) with P(X|Y) remaining fixed i.e. the distribution over outputs/labels changes but the conditional distribution over the input data/features given this new distribution stays the same."
"Data Shift - Concept Drift
This refers to a change in P(YIX) with P(X) remaining fixed i.e. the conditional distribution over outputs/labels changes given the input/features but the distribution of input data/features stays the same. This can be interpreted as a change occurring in the relationship between the input data/features and the output labels."
