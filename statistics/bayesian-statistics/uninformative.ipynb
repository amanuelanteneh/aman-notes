    "As an example consider the problem if estimating the probability of getting a head when flipping a particular coin and denote this probability as $\\theta$. Suppose we have no prior knowledge about what this probability might be for our specific coin so we believe it could be anything from a fair coin to a biased coin which only comes up as tails with every flip. Naturally we would then specify our prior as the uniform distribution $U(0,1)$, on the support $(0,1)$, which has the PDF $p(\\theta)=1$."

It stands to reason then that this would also mean we have no prior knowledge about the value $\\theta^2$ i.e. the probability of getting two heads when flipping the coin two times. But is this lack of knowledge _also_ described by placing an uniform prior on the value of $\\theta$? First let's define $\\phi=\\theta^2$."
